## Why SDG 10 Matters ? Why we chose it

While all SDGs are important, SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities) is particularly urgent in Tunisia due to deep regional, social, and economic disparities that slow down progress on every other goal.

1. Regional Inequality Is One of Tunisiaâ€™s Biggest Challenges

1. Interior and rural areas such as Kasserine, Gafsa, Kef, Siliana, and Jendouba suffer from:
   - Limited job opportunities
   - Poor infrastructure
