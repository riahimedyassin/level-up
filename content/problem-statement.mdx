# Problem statement

<span id="introduction" />
## Introduction

Many talented young Tunisians in interior (non-coastal) areas don't have the same access to education, technology, and job opportunities as those on the coast. This lack of equal opportunity reduces human capital, raises youth unemployment and poverty in the interior, and slows down Tunisia's overall development.

## Major Root Causes

- Poverty and multidimensional deprivation are concentrated in the interior (Center-West and North-West), while coastal regions (Grand Tunis, North-East) show much lower poverty incidence.<a href="/docs/references#worldbank"> According to a paper published by World Bank Group.</a>
- Youth unemployment is extremely high nationwide (~38-40% recently) and is significantly worse for young people from disadvantaged and interior regions, limiting social mobility. <a href="/docs/references#fred">According to the FRED Unemployment rate in Tunisia stats.</a>
- Access to quality education and learning outcomes display urban/rural differences; rural children face higher dropout and lower completion rates.

### Details

#### Geography of poverty and exclusion

The World Bank’s country poverty analysis shows that official poverty is much higher in Center-West (≈37%) and North-West (≈22.5%) compared to coastal Grand Tunis (≈4.7%) and North-East (≈15.2%). This demonstrates a stark territorial inequality: interior regions contain most of the poor households. Use this to argue that opportunities are geographically uneven.

#### Youth unemployment — a lost generation if nothing changes

Tunisia’s youth unemployment rate (ages ~15–24) has been around ~38–40% in recent years (2022–2024), one of the highest in the region; this impacts young people across the country but is worse for those from rural and interior areas where job markets are thin. High youth unemployment undermines motivation for education, fuels migration, and increases the risk of social unrest.

#### Education gaps (urban vs rural)

UNESCO and education-inequality datasets show higher out-of-school and lower completion rates in rural communities, plus weaker school infrastructure and teacher distribution in non-urban districts. If rural youth get lower-quality education, their competitiveness for formal employment and digital jobs decreases—perpetuating inequality.

#### Digital divide and limited tech access

National internet penetration is rising (DataReportal reports ~79% in 2023, ~85% in 2025), but fixed-broadband coverage, speeds, and reliable connectivity lag in interior/rural areas; there are also gaps in digital skills and devices. This constrains remote learning, online job access, freelancing, and ICT entrepreneurship for rural youth. Use this to justify technology-focused interventions. - Source <a href="/docs/references#datareportal">Dataportal</a>

## Conclusion

Rising regional inequality in Tunisia—where the interior regions (Center-West, North-West) record poverty rates several times higher than wealthy coastal zones—coupled with youth unemployment rates near 40%, and persistent rural gaps in education and internet access, shows that talent in the hinterland is systematically excluded from opportunity. Prioritizing SDG 10 (reduced inequalities) in Tunisia’s interior is therefore essential: it addresses the geographic root of exclusion, reduces youth joblessness, and amplifies gains across education, health, and economic growth.
