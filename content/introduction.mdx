# LevelUP

We are a non-governmental organization (NGO) that aims to create a different Tunisia. A Tunisia where everyone shares the opportunity to shine, learn, and "LevelUP". 

## Our Mission

**Empowering Youth in Tunisia's Interior Regions Through Equal Access to Education, Technology, and Opportunities**

LevelUP is dedicated to bridging the opportunity gap between Tunisia's coastal and interior regions by providing young Tunisians in underserved areas with access to quality education, modern technology, and pathways to meaningful employment. We believe that talent is equally distributed, but opportunity is not. Our mission is to unlock the potential of youth in Center-West, North-West, and other interior regions, transforming them into drivers of Tunisia's sustainable development.

### Core Objectives:
- **Education Access**: Provide quality educational resources, tutoring, and skill development programs to youth in interior regions
- **Digital Inclusion**: Bridge the digital divide by improving internet access, digital literacy, and providing technological tools
- **Employment Pathways**: Create connections between talented youth and job opportunities through training, mentorship, and partnerships with employers
- **Digital and Financial Literacy**: Develop human capital in interior regions to reduce poverty and stimulate local economic growth

## Our Vision

**A Tunisia Where Geographic Location Does Not Determine Life Outcomes**

We envision a Tunisia where every young person, regardless of whether they live on the coast or in the interior, has equal access to world-class education, cutting-edge technology, and fulfilling career opportunities. By 2030, we aim to see:

- Youth unemployment in interior regions reduced to national coastal averages
- Digital literacy rates in rural areas matching urban centers
- Increased enrollment and completion rates in secondary and higher education across all regions
- A thriving ecosystem of young entrepreneurs and skilled professionals contributing to the development of interior communities
- Recognition of Tunisia's interior regions as hubs of innovation and talent

Our vision aligns with **SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities)** and contributes to multiple Sustainable Development Goals including SDG 4 (Quality Education), SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), and SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure).

## Key Challenges

### 1. Geographic Poverty Concentration
**Challenge**: Poverty rates in Center-West regions reach 37% and North-West 22.5%, compared to only 4.7% in Grand Tunis. This concentration of poverty creates a cycle of limited resources, poor infrastructure, and reduced opportunities.

**Impact**: 
- Limited family resources for education expenses
- Brain drain as talented youth migrate to coastal cities
- Reduced local economic activity and job creation

### 2. Extreme Youth Unemployment
**Challenge**: Tunisia's youth unemployment rate stands at 38-40%, with significantly worse rates in interior and rural regions. This creates a "lost generation" effect where young people lose motivation and hope.

**Impact**:
- Waste of human potential and skills
- Increased social unrest and instability
- Higher poverty rates among young families
- Migration pressure (internal and international)

### 3. Education Quality Gap
**Challenge**: Rural and interior areas face higher dropout rates, lower completion rates, and weaker educational infrastructure compared to urban coastal regions.

**Impact**:
- Reduced competitiveness in formal job markets
- Limited ability to pursue higher education
- Perpetuation of intergenerational poverty
- Lower digital and technical skills

### 4. Digital Divide
**Challenge**: While national internet penetration reaches 79-85%, interior regions suffer from limited fixed-broadband coverage, slower speeds, unreliable connectivity, and lack of digital devices and skills.

**Impact**:
- Inability to access online learning resources
- Exclusion from remote work and freelancing opportunities
- Limited exposure to digital entrepreneurship
- Reduced participation in the digital economy

### 5. Limited Access to Job Opportunities
**Challenge**: Most formal employment opportunities, internships, and career development programs are concentrated in coastal urban centers, particularly Grand Tunis.

**Impact**:
- Forced migration for career advancement
- Limited local economic development
- Disconnect between education and employment
- Reduced networking and mentorship opportunities

### 6. Infrastructure Deficiencies
**Challenge**: Poor transportation, limited public services, and inadequate educational facilities in interior regions create additional barriers to opportunity.

**Impact**:
- Difficulty accessing educational institutions
- Higher costs for internet and technology
- Limited spaces for community learning and collaboration
