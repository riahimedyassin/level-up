# LevelUP

We are a non-governmental organization (NGO) that aims to create a different Tunisia. A Tunisia where everyone shares the opportunity to shine, learn, and "LevelUP". 

## Our Mission

**Empowering Youth in Tunisia's Interior Regions Through Equal Access to Education, Technology, and Opportunities**

LevelUP is dedicated to bridging the opportunity gap between Tunisia's coastal and interior regions by providing young Tunisians in underserved areas with access to quality education, modern technology, and pathways to meaningful employment. We believe that talent is equally distributed, but opportunity is not. Our mission is to unlock the potential of youth in Center-West, North-West, and other interior regions, transforming them into drivers of Tunisia's sustainable development.

### Core Objectives:
- **Education Access**: Provide quality educational resources, tutoring, and skill development programs to youth in interior regions
- **Digital Inclusion**: Bridge the digital divide by improving internet access, digital literacy, and providing technological tools
- **Employment Pathways**: Create connections between talented youth and job opportunities through training, mentorship, and partnerships with employers
- **Digital and Financial Literacy**: Develop human capital in interior regions to reduce poverty and stimulate local economic growth

## Our Vision

**A Tunisia where everyone gets an opportunity. A Tunisia where everyone get lucky, by chance or strategically.**

We envision a Tunisia where every young person, regardless of whether they live on the coast or in the interior, has equal access to world-class education, cutting-edge technology, and fulfilling career opportunities. By 2030, we aim to see:

- Youth unemployment in interior regions reduced to national coastal averages
- Digital literacy rates in rural areas matching urban centers
- Increased enrollment and completion rates in secondary and higher education across all regions
- A thriving ecosystem of young entrepreneurs and skilled professionals contributing to the development of interior communities
- Recognition of Tunisia's interior regions as hubs of innovation and talent
